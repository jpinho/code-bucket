My Coding Solutions
===================

My coding solutions to Tech Interviews

This repository is intended mainly for educational purposes, and the code shared here is intended to help young fellows, about C programming language.
I started this repo a few days ago (Jan 2014) and the problems (solved here), where extracted from several sources.

For any doubts about my implementations, please drop me an email, and I will try to answer you back as soon as I can.
Note, although I've tested my solutions, I can't guarantee that they are completely bugfree.

Happy Coding.
