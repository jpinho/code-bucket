My Coding Solutions to Tech Interviews

This repository is intended to educational purposes and the code shared here is intended to help young fellows, about C programming language.
I started this repo a few day ago (Jan 2014), and the algorithms to specific problems, solved here, where extracted from several sources.

For any doubts about my implementations, please drop me an email, and I will try to answer you back as soon as I can.

Happy Coding.
